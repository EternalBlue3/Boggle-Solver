# Boggle-Solver
This is a simple python-2 boggle solver. It uses recursion and a dictionary of words to find every word on the 4x4 boggle board.
This program requires the logging and time modules.

To use this program take a board (qu can be used on a single tile), for example:
r e m q
a c i j
p t l s
w qu h p

convert it to one long string:
r e m q a c i j p t l s w qu h p

Then run the program and enter the string when it asks for the board.

To Do:

 - Make GUI with Tkinter

 - Allow for 3x3 and 5x5 board solving
